Image Manipulation
September 2023

This 'read me' describes how to run increase_brightness.asm and greyscale.asm.

I ran my programs on Linux and Windows, using "LF" images.

You will need:
- QtSpim to compile and run the program.

It seems like QtSpim can't create files, so you will need to create an empty file manually(e.g on Linux "touch output.ppm" or on Windows "New-Item output.txt" ). "fileIn" and "fileOut" need to be entered as absolute path and make sure "fileOut" path matches created file.
